Ch. 0 Notes

Like C, but updated
Focus on simplicity
Interesting concurrency
Object Oriented
Has garbage collection
Jack of all trades, but specializes in systems tools
Has pointers!
Compiled
Package system
Influenced by Pascal, Modula-2, C

Missing: Implicit conversions, constructors/destructors, overloading, default parameter values, inheritance, generics

Simple type system

No classes, but OOP
No inheritance, all composition

Ch. 2 Notes

Standard variable naming conventions
Scope same as C
Variable declaration: var name type = expression
Type is optional - inferred
Expression is optional - set to '0' of respective type
Short variable declaration: name := expression, not to be confused with =
Pointers - like they are in C
new keyword - heap
Lifetime - same as Java
userdefined types - type name underlying-type
